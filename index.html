            <p>Norman Ernest Borlaug (March 25, 1914 â€“ September 12, 2009) was an American agronomist and humanitarian who has been called "the father of the Green Revolution" for his role in initiating and developing high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties. His work saved millions from starvation in the 1960s and 1970s, and he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.</p>
            <p>Borlaug's contributions to agriculture were revolutionary.  His development of semi-dwarf, high-yielding, disease-resistant wheat varieties, along with improved agricultural practices, dramatically increased wheat production worldwide. This achievement was particularly impactful in countries facing food shortages.</p>
